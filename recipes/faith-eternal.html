        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Kujou Sara's specialty. Forget calling it a dish, this is really more like a snack. The sweet, fluffy flavor really doesn't seem to suit Sara's own preferences. Wait a moment. That symbol on the snack â€” does this have to do with a certain other person's tastes instead?</p>
        
        <h2>Ingedients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>5 Eggs</li>
            <li>4 Tbsp Dashi</li>
            <li>2 Tbsp Sugar</li>
            <li>1 tsp Salt</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp Light Soy Sauce</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp Mirin</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a bowl, whisk all ingredients together.</li>
            <li>Heat up a pan on medium heat and lightly oil.</li>
            <li>Ladle in egg until the whole surface is covered.  Once the eggs solidify, place honey in the middle of the egg.</li>
            <li>Release the eggs with chopsticks.  Tilt pan forward and make a flip on the egg.  About 1/4 of the egg.  Continue to flip until you hit the other side of the pan.</li>
            <li>When you reach the other side, bring egg back to the original side and ladle in more of the egg mixture.  Lift the egg ensuring that the mixture goes under and cook and flip again.  Repeat steps until all of the egg mixture is used up.</li>
            <li>After the final flip, turn off the heat and let the egg rest in the pan to seal it.  Cooling the egg will allow you to handle it easier.</li>
        </ol>
